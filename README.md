# AI-MATHPAD-CALCULATOR

This project is an interactive web application that allows users to draw mathematical expressions by hand and receive instant, accurate solutions — all powered by Google's Gemini Flash API and built using Python and Streamlit.

🚀 Key Features

-Drawpad Interface
Users can freely draw mathematical problems using a customizable canvas. Adjust pen size, switch pen colors, and change the background color to suit your drawing style or visibility preferences.

-One-Click Solve with Gemini
After drawing your problem, simply click the “Solve Drawing Using Gemini” button. The app sends your sketch to Gemini Flash, which performs real-time image-to-text recognition to understand your handwritten math expression.

-Accurate Solution Display
The recognized expression is displayed as digital text, and the app automatically computes and shows the final solution — making it a helpful tool for students, educators, or anyone working with handwritten math.
